**Real-time Chat Application using Sockets and Threads in Python**

I developed a **multi-client chat application** using Python, leveraging **sockets** for client-server communication and **threading** for handling concurrent connections. The application includes a server that listens for client messages and broadcasts them to all connected users in real time. Key features include:

- **Threaded communication** for handling multiple clients simultaneously.
- **Real-time message exchange** between users with efficient broadcasting.
- Simple and intuitive **username-based messaging system** for easy identification.
- Robust error handling to ensure a stable and responsive server.

This project has enhanced my understanding of socket programming and concurrent execution in Python, and I'm excited to explore more in the field of network programming.
